## Description 
This project is using concepts I learned from nodejs to create a README file generator using prompts from the command line. Some of the challenges I've faced during this project is just learning how to acclimate to working in the backend of things like working from the command line, getting adjusted to all the new node concepts. These past few weeks have been difficult for me as I've been in and out of being sick among other life obstacles, so another challenge was just learning how to balance catching up in class and going back to complete assignments.
